/**
 * This interface is responsible for providing clients of the {@link MonitoringCenter} with methods for collecting
 * metrics under a particular namespace. MetricCollector is analogous to a logger retrieved from SLF4J's LoggerFactory.
 * As such, a typical idiom for instantiating a MetricCollector is:
 * <pre>{@code
 * private static final MetricCollector metricCollector = MonitoringCenter.getMetricCollector(SampleService.class);
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * In addition to the ability to instantiate or retrieve Dropwizard's {@link Metric} implementations (e.g.,
 * Counter), this interface exposes high-level methods for registering and instrumenting collections, maps, caches,
 * executors, and data sources. The instrumentation methods return a proxy instance that has to be employed in lieu
 * of the original instance.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * All metrics registered within a MetricCollector are prefixed with its namespace (defined when retrieving a
 * MetricCollector instance from MonitoringCenter; see {@link MonitoringCenter#getMetricCollector(String, String...)}).
 * A MetricCollector also enforces a metric naming policy specified in the MonitoringCenter's configuration
 * (see {@link net.centro.rtb.monitoringcenter.config.MetricNamePostfixPolicy}). Thus, a histogram named "foo" may be
 * registered as "fooHistogram", given an appropriate MetricNamePostfixPolicy (e.g.,
 * {@link net.centro.rtb.monitoringcenter.config.MetricNamePostfixPolicy#ADD_COMPOSITE_TYPES}).
 * </p>
 * <p>In other words, all metrics registered with a MetricCollector will follow the naming schema below:
 * <br><br>
 * <tt>
 * [MetricCollector's namespace].[name].[additionalNames][postfix as dictated by the MetricNamePostfixPolicy]
 * </tt>,<br><br> where "." is the separator character expressed by
 * {@link net.centro.rtb.monitoringcenter.util.MetricNamingUtil#SEPARATOR}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For instance, <tt>getMeter("requests", "errors", "400")</tt> registered with a MetricCollector named
 * "SampleServlet" and given
 * {@link net.centro.rtb.monitoringcenter.config.MetricNamePostfixPolicy#ADD_COMPOSITE_TYPES}, will yield a meter
 * named "SampleServlet.requests.errors.400Meter".
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that the node-specific prefix (such as "bidder.east.lb10-p2e.114") is appended on demand during the
 * reporting stage.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * MetricCollector abstracts away all the naming intricacies mentioned above, allowing the client to simply
 * reference a metric by its short name ("coins" vs "SampleService.coinsMeter").
 * </p>
